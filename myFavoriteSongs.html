	<h1>Music: My ability to fully express my culture</h1>
	<p>Music is one of the most important things in my life. It not only has the power to lift my spirts, but also allows me to connect with my culture. I am Dominican and Puerto Rican who never learned Spanish growing up. However, music became my gateway to learning the langauge in a fun way! It also allows me to have a better connection with my family.</p>
